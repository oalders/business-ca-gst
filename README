DESCRIPTION
    A tax table for Canadian GST/HST payments. Actual tax calculations are
    left as an exercise for the reader. Please see
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_taxes_in_Canada> for a more detailed
    explanation of how GST and HST works (it's not as simple as one might
    hope).

        codes.
